					<h1>Computer Building 2</h1>
					<h2>I will walk you though my latest PC build with photos.</h2>
					<p>A year and a bit on, my computer needed an upgrade. I was still planning to use my old one but not as much. I will walk you through the building process, step by step.</p>

					<img src="images/one.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;">	
					<h2>To this</h2>
					<img src="images/finish.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;">	
					<p>this time round I went with an Intel 6th gen Skylake processor as AMD processors werenâ€™t that good last time. Because of this change of processor I would need to have a motherboard with a different type of socket, not AM3+ but Z170 as this is what intel processors need.<br>
					I built this one in another NZXT case, but a different model - the mid-tower S-340, which is smaller than the last but is honestly the best case I have ever built in, there is so much room, a special area for the PSU and loads of holes for cable management.</p>

					<p>The specifications are the following - <br>
						CPU - Intel i5-6600k <br>
						Graphics Card - MSI Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 <br>
						Motherboard - MSI M5 Z170 LGA1151 <br>
						RAM - GSkill RipJaws DDR4 2x8GB Sticks (16GB) <br>
						CPU Cooler - Hyper 212 Evo <br>
						SSD - 750GB SSD <br>
						PSU - Corsair 750W <br>
						Case - NZXT S-340 White</p>

					<h2>The power supply is in.</h2>

					<h2>The RAM sticks are installed into the motherboard.</h2>

					<h2>The CPU has been carefully placed into its socket, making sure not to bend any pins!</h2>
					<img src="images/cpu.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;">
					<h2>After lots of fiddling, the CPU Cooler has finally been installed.</h2>
					<img src="images/cooler.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;">
					<h2>I then install the motherboard into the case using the standoff pins. This was quite tricky.</h2>
					<img src="images/mobo.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;">
					<h2>I have installed the SSD onto the conviniently located trays that are fitted into this amazing case.</h2>
					<img src="images/ssd.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;">
					<h2>I then install the Wi-Fi card. It can be put right under the GPU.</h2>
					<img src="images/network.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;">
					<h2>I then install the expensive bit, the GPU. To do this I have to remove one of the backplates and screw the GPU onto it. It is literally held by ONE screw!</h2>

					<p>Altogether, the build took about 6 hours. I thouroughly enjoyed it. It was my fourth time building a PC and I feel much more confident building one now!</p>
					
					<p>I use this computer for video editing, gaming and game development.</p>
