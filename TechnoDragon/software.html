<h3>Jacob's Journey</h3>
<p>I started out in software by creating simple games on scratch. After spending a few months on scratch I moved on to pyhton, I built a robot and a few basic minecraft plugins. Both of these languages are good for building up logic and problem solving for future coders. Next off I started building web pages with HTML. I then decorated them with CSS and made them interactive with JavaScript. These three languages work VERY well together and are perfect for building websites and webapps. Next up I started programming more complex minecraft plugins with Java. Later on I found out about Phaser - this again looping back to HTML and JavaScipt but this time building 2D games. Currently I am attempting to have a go at swift to create apps for IOS but it is pretty difficult.</p>
<h3>Max's Journey</h3>
<p>I started coding with BBC basic, it was easy to learn and quite memorable. Afterwards I checked out python, I just looked at some tutorials on it and developed a basic understanding. Next up I tried out scratch, it was very easy but very good at building up logic. Currently I am using HTML CSS and JavaScript to make webapps.</p>
<h3>Harry's Journey</h3>
<p>I only recently started coding but have been attending a class on JavaScript. I have also developed a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. I have also had some past expierience with scratch.</p>
<h3>Recommended Journey</h3>
<p> We recommend for new coders to buid up logic on scratch and then move on to python. After spending some time on python we recommend looking into HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build some WebApps - bearing in mind JavaScript can be fairly confusing at first. We also recommend having a quick look at Phaser as it is a fun thing to use. After you have done all of this our recommendation is to start Swift and developing iOS apps.</p>
