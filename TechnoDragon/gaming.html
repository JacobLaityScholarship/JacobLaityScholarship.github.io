	<h1>Game Reviews<h1>

	<h3>Blockstorm</h3>
	<p>Although this game is not the most popular one out there it is extremely addictive and fun. There is hours upon hours of amazing content for a fiver</p>

	<h3>Terraria</h3>
	<p> This game isn't too popular, but it is a legendary  game, many people have the misconception between 8 bit modeling and bad graphics, this is the only criticization i've heard, but besides that I think it is a very good game. It has hundreds of hours of content for 6 pounds</p>

	<h3>Assassins Creed </h3>
	<p> These video games are based on historical events and accuracy. This is why I love them, yes I am a massive history nerd! </p>

	<h3>Geometry Dash</h3>
	<p> Ok seriously some people automatically assume that this game is bad becuase it is 2D. Well let me tell you - this game is amazing! For about 2 pounds you are receiving 20 amazing levels and thousands of community made maps. For 2 pounds!</p>

	<h3>Call of Duty</h3>
		<p>I hate this game. I just dont enjoy it - unrealistically fast-paced combat. Some people love it some people hate it</p>

	<h3>ArmA 3</h3>
	<p>Essentially this game is the exact opposite to call of duty. This is a 'military simulator'. A super realistic FPS and Third Person Shooter. Also it has an amazing multiplayer RPG gamemode called Altis Life where you can play as a cop, civilian or a rebel.</p>

	<h3>Total War</h3>
	<p>This is an amazing top - down strategy game. I think the age ratings are a bit unfair - it is a 16 becuase of the incredible difficulty of the game. There is absolutely no swearing or gore! Other than that this top down - historical war strategy game is fantastic</p>

	<h3>Rust</h3>
	<p>This a fantastic multiplayer survival game. It can be very frustrating when someone raids your base and steals all your stuff but other than that this game is a masterpiece!</p>
