<h1>AR drone 2.0</h1>
		
	<p>We have had lots of experience with the AR drone 2.0. One of the first things that we noticed was the simplicity. In the box there is a AR drone, manuel, battery, AR stickers, and the shell. It is fairly simple to fix although you have to break parts to fix others, probaly a money making strategy. It has a 720p 30FPS front camera with a fish eye lens and a low res, high framerate camera on the bottom to keep the steady using auto-stabilisation.</p>

	<h1>DJI</h1>

	<p>DJI is one of the most popular quadcopter companies and in my opinion their drones are the best. They have just come out with a new drone called the Inspire 1, It has a really cool retractable landing gear, a range of 5km and a top speed of 22m/s! It also has an 18 minute flight time with a 4K camera.</p>

	<h1>Build your own drones</h1>


	<p>Some people build their own drones. The hardware is the easy part but making the software is the hard part. Here are some things insida a average drone -  4 arms, some screws, fiberglass plates, landing gear.</p>
