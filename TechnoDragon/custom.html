<h3>Building you own Gaming PC</h3>
<p>I think that most people know by now that it is much cheaper to build your own custom PC then to buy a pre-built one<p>
<p>I myself have built a custom gaming PC before. It has a GTX 970 4GB and a AMD FX8350 8-core 4.7GHz processor. It runs all the latest games on high settings at a good framerate, for 600 pounds - this sort of PC would have cost more in the region of 1000 pounds had I bought it pre-built! </p>
<p>Building your own custom PC is not that hard, there are plenty of video tutorials online, it only took me a few hours!</p>
<p>I highly recommend this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bUghCx9iso">EasyPCBuilder</a>

<h3>Budget PC Tips</h3>
<p> Games take advantage of having a good graphics card more than having a good processor. My advice is to prioritise getting a good graphics card and a decent processor, games will not take advantage of having a fantastic processor as much as a graphics card!</p>

<h3>Alienware 14 top spec Review</h3>
<p> 2.7-2.5 quad core i7, 16GB DDR3 RAM, Nvidia GeForce Gtx 765M. On GTA V the controls were a little bit laggy but the FPS wasn't bad. Unfortunately it isn't very portable and dosen't have a fantastic battery life. Very good keyboard and key travel and cool lights, good amount of travel in the trackpad. A sturdily built computer. The speakers are extremely loud! Occasionaly the keys get stuck under other keys so you have to pull them out. speed - 8/10 portability - 6/10 reliability - 4/10</p>

<h3>MacBook 12 Review</h3>
<p>It's not fast enough to be a gaming computer but from my expieriences it is the perfect computer for coding. It has fantastic speakers and a very nice trackpad. The keyboard is VERY weird at first but you get used to it very quickly. The retina display is very crisp and sharp and the laptop is very small, thin and light. The only downside is that it only has a USB-C port and a headphone jack, so you need to carry around an adapter - although I have rarely ever had to use it as most things are wireless now - I imagine apple was trying to encourage wireless electronics. The OS is very well optimised for the computer as well. The MacBook also has a consistently good battery life. speed - 5/10 (gets the job done) portability - 10/10 reliability - 8.5/10\</p>
