					<h1>Computer Building 1</h1>
					<h2>I decided to build a computer in the summer of 2015</h2>
					<p>Up until then I had been using my not very fast MacBook to play games on, it was extremely laggy and the laptop got very hot. Also, video games are massive - they take up loads of space and this was causing some of my coding projects to not fit on the computer!</p>
					
					<p>It would run Windows 8.1 - 10 wasn’t out yet, and it would be quite cheap as I didn’t have much money, luckily my dad offered to help with the money as a birthday gift.</p>

					<p>The specifications are the following - <br>
						CPU - AMD FX8350 <br>
						Graphics Card - MSI Nvidia Geforce GTX 970 <br>
						Motherboard - MSI 970 Gaming <br>
						RAM - Kingston HyperX 2x4 GB DDR3 Blue <br>
						CPU Cooler - Hyper 212 Evo <br>
						HDD - WD 1TB Hard Drive <br>
						PSU - EVGA 500B <br>
						Case - NZXT Phantom 530 White <br>
						And some blue lights.</p>

					<p>I installed the PSU first, then put the CPU and RAM into the motherboard. I then installed the CPU cooler (a pain in the bum!) and mounted the motherboard into the case. I then installed the HDD and plugged it into the Motherboard. Finally I installed the GPU, which was terrifying as it is literally held in by one screw and then I wired everything together!</p>
					
					<p>My brother became jealous as he had nowhere to play his games, Lego Worlds and Star Wars Battlefront, as they were quite demanding games, and my old laptop, which I still use! (actually it is what I am making this website on!), wasn’t up to it.</p>

					<p>So as a birthday present for my brother - Our birthday’s are quite close, my Dad purchased the exact parts of my computer, other than a different PSU and red lights and I built that for my brother which he loves.</p>

					<p>I think the best all round component of the build was the Hyper 212 Evo CPU cooler. I have used it in every PC Build I have ever done and it is great. </p>

					<p>I think it would have been better to get and Intel processor as AMD aren’t that good compared to the speed of Skylake and now Kabylake Intel processors.</p>

					<p>Overall, I learnt I lot from building these two computers. I learnt how to install a CPU a GPU and a CPU Cooler. I learnt a lot about cabling in PCs as well!</p>
